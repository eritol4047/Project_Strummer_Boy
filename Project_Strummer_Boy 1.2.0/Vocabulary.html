			<h3>Acoustic Guitar</h3>
			<p>
			Is a guitar that has a Sound Hole and has strings tied to the bridge. 
			This type of guitar is more natural sounding.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>

			<h3>Beat</h3>
			<p>
			It is the unit of musical time. It is much like a heartbeat or a pulse,
			in that it is measured within a period of time.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3 id="body">Body</h3>
			<p>
			This is where you strum and pluck the strings. On this part of the guitar, 
			there is a hole on acoustic guitar where you strum the strings. On Electric 
			guitars, there is no hole, you just strum or pluck the string at the center 
			between where the strings are tied and the base of the neck.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Bridge</h3>
			<p>
			This is a device that supports the strings and transmits the vibration. 
			It’s on the body side of the guitar and it is where the strings are tied in 
			place. On an electric guitar, the strings are tied past the bridge instead. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Chords</h3>
			<p>
			These refer to how one or more fingers are placed on the Neck of the guitar 
			but are always strummed in a pattern. They have one or more fingers placed 
			on different frets on the Neck. For example, a note might be the lower E string 
			on the second fret. Plucked it’s a note, but strummed with other fingers, 
			it becomes a chord. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Cutaway</h3>
			<p>
			This is an indentation on the top body of a guitar to allow for easier access 
			to the highest frets on a guitar. These aren’t important for guitars to have, 
			but it is helpful. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
			<p>
			This is a guitar that has Pickups in place of a Sound Hole and has knobs,
			a pickup selector, and an output jack. This type of guitar paired with a 
			speaker is what can give a huge variety of sounds.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Frets</h3>
			<p>
			These are the spaces between the vertical lines when holding the guitar 
			on your lap. Some of these have dots on them indicating the number fret it is.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Head</h3>
			<p>
			Refers to the top of the guitar where you can turn the knobs.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Knobs</h3>
			<p>
			On an electric guitar, these are volume/tone adjusters where you can remotely 
			control the volume on the guitar itself.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Nut</h3>
			<p>
			This is a notched piece of plastic or bone between the neck and head on a guitar.
			The notches are the strings sit in order to keep them aligned across the neck while
			pulled onto the pegs above.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Neck</h3>
			<p>
			This is the main part of the guitar where your off hand goes. This is where 
			you place your fingers along the center of each fret. Most are right-handed, 
			meaning you will place your left hand, other guitars have you place your right 
			hand on this part of the guitar. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>
			A note simply refers to the fret where you place your finger to make the sound. 
			For example, A1 refers to the first fret on the string second from the top of 
			the guitar, or second from the lower E string depending on how the person is 
			referring to it. Either way it’s the same note. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Output Jack</h3>
			<p>
			This is a plug that you use to plug a guitar into a speaker for a louder, 
			or even different, sound. These are on all electric guitars but are less common 
			on acoustic guitars. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Pick</h3>
			<p>
			This is a tool that is shaped in a triangle that is used to pluck or strum 
			the strings of a guitar. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Pick Guard</h3>
			<p>
			This is the big space on a guitar that goes on top of the wood underneath 
			the Sound Hole. This is to preserve the wood from scratches that could be made 
			when strumming or plucking with a pick.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Pickup Selector Switch</h3>
			<p>
			On Electric guitars, these are small switches used for getting a different 
			sound out of a guitar. They typically have 3 to 5 modes depending on the model. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Pickups</h3>
			<p>
			These are devices on electric guitars that pick up the sound, are embedded into 
			the body and come in two versions. One with six magnetic bars, one for each string 
			and the other with a single magnet across metal rods. 
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Pluck</h3>
			<p>
			The action of pulling a string on the body to note a sound.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>

			<h3>Rythm</h3>
			<p>
			The systematic arrangement of musical sounds. This is performed with notes hitting in
			a specific pattern.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Sound Hole</h3>
			<p>
			This is the hollowed-out hole on the body of the guitar. Contrary to popular belief, 
			it doesn’t produce sound, but is designed to amplify sound the sound without a speaker.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Strings</h3>
			<p>
			These are the vibrating elements that make the sound on a guitar. 
			Some guitars have more than 6 strings, and others have less. This is 
			what differentiates string instruments from the other types of instruments. 
			The most common guitars have 6 strings, but there are guitars out there 
			with 4, 7, and even 12 strings.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Strum</h3>
			<p>
			The action of moving a finger, thumb or pick across a guitar pulling multiple 
			strings to create a harmonious sound of strings.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Tempo</h3>
			<p>
			This is the pace in which a song is to be played. This can vary with
			performance, but all instruments within the same performance follow a particular
			pace. Tempo in Italian translates to time. In music, we simply refer
			to it being slow, quick or moderate.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Time Signature</h3>
			<p>
			This is the two numbers at the beginning of a music sheet that indicates two things; how many beats
			in a measure, and the pace or how many beats is that whole meausure. A 4&frasl;4 measure indicates
			that the 4 on top is the beats per measure and the bottom 4 is the basic note measurement within that measure.
			It gets confusing at first, but just count every 4 beats as a measure, then play
			the notes in any rythm while counting to 4 and it'll start to become clear.
			</p>
			<div id="guitarDiv">
			<img src="./image/guitarDiv.jpg" alt="divider" class="center"/>
			
			<h3>Tuning Pegs</h3>
			<p>
			Refers to the six points on each side of the head. These are used for 
			tuning the strings. The tighter you turn a peg, the higher the sound on 
			the string when pulled. The looser the string, the lower the sound. 
			Make sure you start tuning here.
