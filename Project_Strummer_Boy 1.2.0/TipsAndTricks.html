		A good majority of songs usually are between 2 to 6 chords with some of the 
		most popular songs having 3 chords for main verses, so don’t feel like you must 
		learn every chord and note to be able to play your favorite song.

		A good practice is to never memorize chords or notes. Practice until it becomes 
		pure muscle memory. After that, you’ll likely be able to play the song blindfolded 
		as half the time you may not even notice your hands doing all the work.

		A good rule to follow is when hovering over the neck of the guitar, don’t try to lift 
		your fingers on every single note. Instead, only pick up your finger when going to 
		a different string and when switching notes on the same string, just slide your finger 
		along the neck. This not only picks up the pace, but it puts less strain your hands 
		and makes it easier to play.

		A good way to learn music is to search music sheets for tab notes. Those are the best 
		sheets for newcomers because the sheets are labeled with the fret numbers on each line 
		and the lines are mapped directly from the lowest sounding string to the highest sound. 
		Even when these don’t sound right, you can easily play in succession changing one note 
		to something different until it sounds like the song you’re trying to learn.

		When tuning a guitar, you can tune the lowest string, then use the fourth or fifth fret 
		to tune the next string in succession. This is the way to tune a guitar without a tuner 
		and is extremely helpful when needed.
		</p>

		<p>
		There are different types of tuning for a guitar, but the most common one to play any 
		song is called Standard Tuning. You can set an electric tuner or a tuning app on your 
		phone for other tunings, so don’t be afraid to try them out, but starting out, tune 
		your guitar to Standard Tuning. This is E A D G B E. This is the most adaptable tuning, 
		so this is the best one to use to get the most range.

		<p>
		This is extremely important, but for the hand you use on the neck, always run cold water 
		on the tips after you’re done practicing to help minimize any blisters, and if you are 
		starting out, practice in short 15-to-30-minute bursts until your fingertips harden. 
		After that, you can go as long as you want and will eventually get used to the feeling.
		</p>

		<p>
		Don’t focus on a complete song all at once. When learning a song, pick a small part and 
		practice that. Once you master that, do another small part and master that. Combine it 
		only when you have two or more parts at a time and only combine the parts you mastered.
		</p>

		<p>
		Don’t get hung up on where your finger is on the fret. As long as the tip is pressed on 
		the right fret, it’ll make the right sound. For example, if your finger lands on top of 
		the bar, it’ll still make the same note sound as the fret above it on the neck, it won’t 
		sound perfect, but it’ll sound close enough for most to not hear a difference. Only pro 
		musicians can hear the difference anyways, so just stay somewhere on the right fret and 
		you’re good.

		<p>
		Start with simple notes. Practice between 3 to 4 notes close together. After a little
		bit, you can add an extra beat on each note which changes up the rythm. Each tiny
		adjustment can change up the entire rythm into a brand new one.
